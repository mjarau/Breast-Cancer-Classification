# Breast Cancer Classification
In this project, breast cancer classification was performed using several Machine Learning algorithms. The tested models were then evaluated in order to determine the most suitable ML model that demonstrated the best prediction of whether the cancer is benign or malignant. 

## Data
The data used in this prediction was obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. It consists of 33 columns and 569 rows in which 30 predicting features. Features were computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
